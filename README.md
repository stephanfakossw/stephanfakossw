### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the SSW Senior Account. I'm coming to SSW with more than 5 years of accounting experience under my belt, and a passion for technology and solving accountancy problems.

Coming from a chartered accounting role, I'm working closely with our Financial Controller to ensure SSW runs smoothly, including leading our finance reporting, as well as our general finance and other admin duties.

I'm passionate about finance and can help you with Xero Accounting, automation, and management accounting.
